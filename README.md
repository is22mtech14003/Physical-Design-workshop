# Physical Design RTL2GDS using OpenLane/SKY130 workshop
### This repository contains all the information studied and created during the [Advanced Physical Design](https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com/advanced-physical-design-using-openlane-sky130/) Using [OpenLANE / SKY130](https://openlane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) workshop. It is primarily foucused on a complete RTL2GDS flow using the open-soucre flow named OpenLANE. [PICORV32A](https://github.com/YosysHQ/picorv32) RISC-V core design is used for the purpose
